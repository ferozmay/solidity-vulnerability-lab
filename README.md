# solidity-vulnerability-lab
This lab focuses on the Solidity programming language, how to deploy a smart contract on the Blockchain and avoid exploits such as reentrancy. 

## Setup
1. Download Remix from online.
2. Enable the Solidity compiler and deploy and run transactions in Remix.
3. Work in the supplier.txt file

## Background
The exercises in this lab involve three contracts that interact with each other: Paylock, Supplier, and Rental. The Paylock contract represents a work order that can be collected by a customer. The Supplier contract interacts with the Paylock contract and the Rental contract to complete its work. The exercises focus on adding features and logic to these contracts.

## Exercises
1. Exercise 1: Add a tick function to model the passage of time in the Paylock contract. Modify the collect functions to adhere to deadlines based on the clock variable.
2. Exercise 2: Add an address variable and modify the tick function to allow it to be called only by a specific address.
3. Exercise 3: Add functions in the Supplier contract to acquire and return a resource. Modify the functions to interact with the Rental contract.
4. Exercise 4: Modify the Rental contract to require payment and return a deposit. Implement the receive function in the Supplier contract and update the external function calls.
5. Exercise 5: Exploit a security flaw in the Rental contract to take more Ether than deposited. Implement this vulnerability in the Supplier contract.
6. Exercise 6: Fix the security flaw in the Rental contract by reordering the lines in the retrieve_resource function.
